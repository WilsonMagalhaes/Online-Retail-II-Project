Notebooks Explanations

This document provides an overview of the five notebooks/scripts used in this project, explaining their purpose and functionality.

1. Data Cleaning (Data_Cleaning_Online_Retail_II)

Loads the Online Retail II dataset.

Cleans missing values, removes invalid prices, and filters unreliable data.

Saves the cleaned dataset as cleaned_data_online_retail_II.csv.

2. Co-Occurrence Analysis (Create_Product_Correlation_Table)

Creates a basket matrix (products per invoice).

Computes a co-occurrence matrix (how often products are purchased together).

Normalizes co-occurrence values to measure product relationships.

Saves the result as co_basket.csv.

3. Semantic Similarity (Calculate_Semantics_X_Correlation)

Uses Sentence Transformers to compute semantic similarity between product descriptions.

Identifies pairs of products with high correlation but low semantic similarity.

Saves the result as dataFrameWithDescriptionsAndCorrelation.csv.

4. Statistical Significance (Statistical_Significance_Test)

Uses the Chi-Square test to filter product pairs that are statistically significant.

Ensures relationships are not due to random chance.

Saves the result as significant_pairs.csv.

5. Query and Analysis (Queries_And_Analysis)

Extracts key business insights, such as:

Revenue per country/customer/product.

Most frequently purchased products.

Revenue trends over time.

Generates visualizations for revenue trends and top-selling products.

Each script contributes to understanding product relationships, customer behavior, and sales trends using statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
