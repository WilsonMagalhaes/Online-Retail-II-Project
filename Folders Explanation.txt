Folders Explanation

This document provides an overview of the five folders used in this project, explaining their purpose.

DataBases Folder:
Contains all the databases used in this project, including the main data source "online_retail_II", which can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository. It also includes databases created during the project's development.

Notebooks Folder:
Contains the Google Colab notebooks created throughout the development of this project. These notebooks showcase each step, transformation, and visualization, providing insight into my thought process during the project. For more detailed information about each notebook, please refer to the "Notebooks Explanations" file.

Notebooks in .py Folder:
Contains the Google Colab notebooks in .py format. This is a convenient way to view the code from the notebooks in a text editor or an IDE that does not support the .ipynb format.

Power BI Folder:
Contains a .pbix file with analyses and visualizations of the cleaned_data_online_retail_II database using Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

Python Scripts Folder:
Contains Python scripts based on functions that perform the same tasks as the Google Colab notebooks. While they may be harder to understand, these scripts automate the process â€” you only need to run the main function. If you want to quickly run the process, I recommend using these scripts. However, if you prefer to follow the step-by-step development and gain a deeper understanding, I suggest using the notebooks in the "Notebooks" folder.
